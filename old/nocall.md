# Don't Call Me >.<
## Please DM Me for help before you call me.
This is since I may be doing other things and are not able to call with you right now. By sending me a message you let me answer your question instantly if I have the answer.

Even if I am online I may either:
- Be on mobile 
- Doing work

So please DM Me before you call. This will insure that I pickup and your question gets answered immediately.

Thanks :)
