1. **Run Minecraft 1.7.10 (Vanilla)**

2. **Download Forge Client 1.7.10**

      2a. [Mac Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/dxyikeqtx76x8yy/forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1558-1.7.10-installer.jar/file) \| [Windows Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/98pvwflc5pwvp49/forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1558-1.7.10-installer-win.exe/file)

      2b. Click "Install Client" then Ok.
      
3. **Attempt to Launch Forge 1.7.10**

      It should be automatically there as you open Minecraft (You'll need to reopen it)
      
      If it isn't try to add it as an installation (The way you'd switch versions)
      
      If it still isn't there DM Me on Discord with your `.log` file which should have been made upon downloading the client.

4. **Download the Appropriate Mods for the Server.**

      Currently you only need to download __Advanced Lightsabers__, __BiblioCraft__, and __Inventory Pets__ (Updated 1/21/2020)

      [You can download them here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/06w6ju4bm1cn11d/Star_Wars.zip/file)

      *NOTE: For the next step you'll need to unzip the zip folder.*

5. **Find your .minecraft Folder.**

      If you need help with this launch your game then open your resource pack folder

6. **Add The Mod to your Mods Folder**

      Open your Mods folder in the .minecraft folder.
      
      Drag and Drop (or copy and paste) the mods you downloaded in step 4.
      
7. **Relaunch Minecraft Forge and you should be able to connect to the server!**
