    <p><span>Long Answer:</span> I personally do not feel like I am a furry, and am not looking to be a furry. I am a duck.</p>
    <p>Some people may classify me as a Furry due to my actions. For Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Saying uwu, owo, and the word boop</li>
      <li>Having some fluff on my avatar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even though these are traits that are used by furries, I personally do not identify as one, which is all that matters.</p>
    <p>If you don't like that opinion and would like to keep calling me a furry, you will just be wrong and unaccepting of others.</p>
