# Why to Fill out a Support Ticket

Hello, you have been redirected to this page since you didn't go through the process of filling out a support ticket.

Please read the following messages below to understand why we use support tickets.

## Why do we have support tickets?

Support tickets are so that there is a queue of messages waiting to be answered. When you DM Me (Duck) for all the information it overloads my messages.
This is annoying and sometimes there are other staff avalible to help, so when you fill out a support ticket you'll be able to:

- Not be told "I can't do it right now"

- Not be un-answered for a while

- Be able to get the fastest support

## Why do I need a support ticket for a simple question?

This is so that my (Duck) phone doesn't blow up with questions needing to be answered and so that you can get the fastest responce time possible.

## I'm still going to do it...

Well... I may read your message but not respond for at least 5 hours because we have a place for those messages.

Even after those 5 hours your question will not be answered and you will be redirected to this page again and told to fill out a support ticket.
So stop doing it... it's useless and may get you blocked from messaging me.
